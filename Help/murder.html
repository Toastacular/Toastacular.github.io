	<div style="text-align:left;margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em">

	Note: large parts of this are the same as the Charmed Path, with some key differences, notably the <b>Aftane</b> and <b>Clairvoyance spell</b>.<br>
	<br>
	There is a variant of this path, the <b>Soft Murder</b> path. This is a slight variation, and affects if you kill Sir Ronald, or another and you are blamed for it.<br>
	<br>
	Start at the School. Check the history class and pick up Mr. Beasley's paper.<br>
	<br>
	Go to the Library. Talk to Ms. Titus, and then visit the Reference section. Talk to Monique and give her the paper.<br>
	She will tell you about Sir Ronald and the mansion he lives in.<br>
	<br>
	Find a Taxi and visit Sir Ronald<br>
	<br>
	<b>demand Sir Ronald to give you the book, then<br>
	tell Sir Ronald that you must have the book</b><br>
	<br>
	<b>Full Murder Path: </b><br>
	wrestle for the gun<br>
	Pickup the <b>book</b><br>
	Pickup the <b>money</b><br>
	<br>
	OR<br>
	<br>
	<b>Soft Murder Path:</b> <br>
	back down and leave the Mansion. You are locked out<br>
	Follow the ghost to the Sacred Clearing<br>
	Jump through the wall (Bad ending if you refuse)<br>
	Find Sir Ronald's dead body and pickup the Book and money<br>
	<br>
	<b>The two variations only differ from here in story text, the progression of the game is otherwise the same</b><br>
	<br>
	Exit the house and take the waiting taxi back to the school<br>
	Enter the school and go to Mr. Beasley's office<br>
	Tell him you have the book<br>
	Do not give him the book<br>
	ask Mr Beasley what does mana do, and then<br>
	Ask where to find magic stones<br>
	Exit the room and meet your friend Catherine<br>
	<br>
	Exit the school and walk to the library<br>
	Enter the library<br>

	<b>Two slightly different versions here - Kate can be either in the park or on the park bridge. The event is otherwise identical</b><br>
	Talk to Kate (do not leave without talking to her!!!! Unless you want the annoy her)<br>
	Be nice and offer to study with her<br>
	<b>OR</b><br>
	Be nasty and get a extra old stone later, but this locks out all events for her, except charming her (say the study event below will not happen)<br>
	<br>
	<b>The walkthrough from here assumes you are nice to Kate</b><br>

	<b>From this point onward there is no difference in the Murder/Charmed path, see the equivalent part from here for the Seance, Ritual, and Kate and Davy<br>
	<br>
	Also the order of events here can be done differently than shown, this is just my last playthrough</b><br>
	<br>
	<b>Note</b>: During the Ritual you cannot ask Sir Ronald for advice and Sarah does not help. Basically you need to know or guess the trick for the skull.<br>
	<br>
	Sarah can give you the Aftane, once you know you need it (after charming Victoria and learning about Seances)<br>
	Ask Sarah about the Aftane<br>
	Ask about the Aftane, ask to see the safe, cast Pass and pick up the <b>Aftane</b><br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-size:12pt;"><b>Other People to Charm</b></span><br>
	<br>
	<b>Kristin the Bank Manager</b><br>
	You only get a single meeting with Kristin on this path, after you talk to you mother about getting help to apply for a credit card<br>
	Delay this meeting until you know Shielded Charm, then meet and charm her<br>
