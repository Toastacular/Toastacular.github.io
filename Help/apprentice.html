	<div style="text-align:left;margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em">

	<br>Start at the School. Check the history classroom and pick up Mr. Beasley's paper.
	<br>
	<br>Go to the Library. Talk to Ms. Titus, and then visit the Reference section. Talk to Monique and give her the paper.
	<br>She will tell you about Sir Ronald and the mansion he lives in.
	<br>
	<br>Find a Taxi and visit Sir Ronald.
	<br><b>NOTE:<br>taxi's have a random chance to appear at places. If one is not there wander to check another rank or enter/exit a building.</b>
	<br>
	<br>Politely introduce yourself and never demand the book, and accept his apprenticeship when offered.
	<br><b>The option to refuse is a partly complete Conspiracy Path</b>
	<br>
	<br>Thank him, and discuss financial aid to get a Letter of Credit for $100
	<br>
	<br>Use the waiting Taxi and go to Kollam Street, or directly to the shopping center.
	<br>Visit the Bank and speak to Ellie the bank teller and open an account. Give her the letter of credit and visit the Manager Kristin to be advanced $100.
	<br>
	<br><b>NOTE: So long as you have less than $20 on you when you see Sir Roland, he'll give you another letter of credit. You can deposit up to $200 in the bank. At a later point in the game this account limit can be raised, of if enough days pass (1 month).</b>
	<br>
	<br>Go to school and talk to Beasley about magic stones. You could optionally first visit the Library and talk to Monique.
	<br>
	<br><b>Two slightly different versions here - Kate can be either in the park or on the park bridge. The event is otherwise identical</b>
	<br>Talk to Kate (do not leave without talking to her!!!!)
	<br>Be nice and offer to study with her
	<br><b>OR</b>
	<br>Be nasty and get a extra old stone later, but this locks out all events for her, except charming her (say the study event below will not happen)
	<br>
	<br><b>The walkthrough from here assumes you are nice to Kate</b>
	<br>
	<br>Go to the park and take the kite from the tree and pick-up the string
	<br>Go to the wild ranges and get your first old stone. Explore the stones.
	<br>
	<br>Go to the Library and study with Kate. The answers are

		</div>
	</div>There is no reason to fail this aside from seeing some minorly different events, it will delay getting the magnet for a while. The delivery girl can still be 'gotten' by visiting her at the TV Station
	<br>
	<br>Go to Yoolaroo Dr (via the alley) and visit the Granger house. Talk or not to Mrs Granger (you can do this later if desired, see <b>later (MG)</b> for details)
	<br>Visit Kate, chat with her, bet her about Bruce Lee. the answer is <b>Game of Death</b>. Note getting it wrong has some nice images too!
	<br>
	<br>Find a taxi and go to see Sir Ronald and give him the stone. Learn "Tuo Duo", the clairvoyance spell.
	<br>He will ask you to find a lost <b>key</b>
	<br>
	<br>Take the waiting taxi to the Library, and go to the office where the crash occurred.
	<br>Talk to Tess Adams and ask for help to decipher a spell. Learn "Serphoni", the Pass spell to walk though walls.
	<br>
	<br>Go to the School, then the Park and the Wild Ranges and <b>use</b> your stone.
	<br><b>As needed through-out the game return here to use any stones found.</b>
	<br>A ghost will appear, follow it to the school, your street and then to a side alley. Watch the ghost walk through the wall.
	<br>Cast Pass to enter the Hidden Room, and learn "Dai Chu", the Charm spell. (Note: Kate leaves her home now)
	<br>When mana permits cast Clairvoyance for some insight into the statue (it is also <b>needed</b> for a later event)
	<br>
	<br>Leave the Hidden Room (<b>optional, you can do this later</b>) Cast Clairvoyance to see the grate, with a key in it.
	<br>
	<br>Return to the Granger house, and talk to Mrs Granger <b>(MG)</b>.
	<br>Two mutually exclusive alternatives (first is preferable)
	<br>
	<ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
		<li>Tell Mrs Granger that she's pretty, if she works out and if she finds anything. Go get an old stone.</li>
		<li>Tell Mrs Granger that she's pretty, ask her is she needs help and do the puzzle, the answer is

			<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

				</div>
			</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>Note: from here things can be a little variable, for instance I commonly charm Mrs Granger here, but the original author of this walk-through does Madison
	<br>
	<br>Also you should consider getting the "Manipulative Charms" training before charming Mrs Granger, but it it optional. To learn it here you need to charm Madison AND Tess first.
	<br>
	<br>Return home and visit your mother and she will give you some cash, also talk to your sister Tracy for some insight.
	<br>
	<br><b>(assuming you answered the radio quiz correctly)</b>
	<br>Answer the door, it is a delivery girl with your prize, a stereo system
	<br>Ask Madison inside, she will trip and break the speaker of the stereo. Pick up the magnet and use it.
	<br>You can <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>Charm Madison</b></span> now!
	<br>Notes:
	<br>
	<ul class="bbc_list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
		<li>You can skip charming her now, and visit her later at the TV/Radio Station. You get one visit to charm her again</li>
		<li>You can ignore the door, and you will find the damaged stereo and magnet when you next visit your bed room. You can visit the TV/Radio station for a chance to charm her</li>
		<li><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><b>(Explicit Only)</b>
If you are female and charm Madison, choose "I want to fuck you" to get
a strap-on. Can be gotten at home and at the TV/Radio station charming
variations</span>
		</li>
	</ul>Use the magnet to create a String &amp; Magnet, leave your house, go to the alley. If you have not before, cast Clairvoyance.
	<br>Use the String &amp; Magnet to get the Rusty Key
	<br>
	<br>Find a taxi to go see Sir Ronald and give him the key. He will give you the <b>Aftane</b>
	<br>Remember, about the Letters of Credit, so make sure you only have enough money to get there and back. so he will give you another letter of credit!
	<br>
	<br>To use money, the New Age store at the shopping center sells Rustic Stones (depends on you current Mana level), and the General Shop sells a few items, including a paperweight containing an Old Stone. By visiting Sir Ronald repeatedly you can buy all items and multiple stones from the New Age Shop, then go to the wild ranges and use them.
	<br>
	<br>Go back to Yoolaroo Dr and visit the Granger house, and <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>charm Mrs. Granger.</b></span>
	<br>There are 3 variations of this process
	<br>- leave immediately after casting the spell for a minimal effect (don't, as you forfeit a stone BUT it adds some variations to her events and images)
	<br>- wait for her to strip, the basic charm effect, she is a slave to you, a loving MILF slave
	<br>- order her to strip and tell her she is a slut. She will be your Slut MILF
	<br>The actual differences of these are mainly in the charm process itself, but there are minor changes elsewhere.
	<br>Ask her for an <b>artifact</b>, and then ask her to <b>explore the wild ranges</b>.
	<br>
	<br>Walk back to the School and visit Mr Beasley's office.
	<br>Pick up the address to the Robbins house, listen to and delete the message. If you do not then female players will be unable to charm Mr Beasley later.
	<br><b>(optionally now)</b> Cast Pass to get another stone.
	<br>
	<br>Go to the wild ranges and meet Mrs Granger for some sexy times.
	<br>Use your new stone to get some mana.
	<br>
	<br>Return to Yoolaroo Dr and the Granger House and talk to Mrs Granger and ask for anything she found. She will also tell you about the <b>secret tunnel</b> from the Wild Ranges to the Sacred Grove and then to Sir Roland's Mansion. You can now just walk there.
	<br>
	<br>Go to the library, visit Tess,<span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b> charm her.</b></span>
	<br>If mana permits, ask her to get Ms Titus into her office, <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>charm Ms Titus</b></span>
	<br>If mana permits, ask Ms Titus to close the library, visit <span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>Monique and charm her</b></span>. Ask Monique to look for magic for you
	<br>Visit Tess and tell her to go to your home. If you have not charmed Ms Titus and Monique it will be quite a while before you can. <b>It is strongly advised to charm them now</b>
	<br>
	<br><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><b>Male Players ONLY</b><br>Speak to Ms. Titus and take the scroll she offers, and learn "Unstr Hun", the Possession spell.</span>
	<br>
	<br>Go to Town Hall, and speak to Angela asking all questions until she tells you to contact the police about the things she has seen
	<br><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>Charm Angela</b></span>, once charmed there are two options
	<br>
	<ul class="bbc_list">
		<li>Tell her to give you the plans - she will now act submissively, she is your slave</li>

	<br>
	<br>Continue to the Wild Ranges and enter the tunnel and visit Sir Ronald. No special need for this, but you will find a stone in the Sacred Grove and can get more money from Sir Ronald.
	<br>
	<br>Walk/ride a taxi back to your street, Kollam St, and visit the Kelly House
	<br>Talk to Janet Kelly until she does not want to talk to you more.
	<br><span style="color: purple;" class="bbc_color"><b>Charm Janet Kelly</b></span>, there are two variations
	<br>
	<ul class="bbc_list">
		<li>tell her "You forget where your room is, don't you" - Janet will become your personal Bimbo</li>

	</ul>
	<br>Leave Janet and return home. Visit your bedroom and talk to Tess.

	<br>Wait a few more turns and visit your mother again. She will confront you about Tracy, two choices

	<br>
	<br>Take a taxi to the Church "Lady of our Heavenly Father" (or get a lift with Tess, or Teleport).

	<br>
	<br>Go down the stairs at the back of the church into the Church Stores . Get the dagger.
	<br>Go into the catacombs. Do not get the skull there. Cast "Clairvoyance" to find the secret tunnel, then Pass to get out and enter the graveyard.

	<br>Go to the Wild Ranges and get some <b>hemlock</b>, then go to the hotel cellar and visit Kurndorf
