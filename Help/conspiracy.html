Ask Madison inside, she will trip and break the speaker of the stereo. Pick up the magnet and use it.<br />
You can <span style="color:purple;"><b>Charm Madison</b></span> now! Do not select any of the listed conversation options, just cast the spell.<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<li>You can skip charming her now, and visit her later at the TV/Radio Station. You get one visit to charm her again</li>

There are 3 variations of this process<br />

<li>wait for her to strip, the basic charm effect, she is a slave to you, a loving MILF slave</li>
<li>order her to strip and tell her she is a slut. She will be your Slut MILF</li>
<br />
The actual differences of these are mainly in the charm process itself, but there are minor changes elsewhere and mostly are for the Minimal case<br />
<br />

Ask her to <b>explore the wild ranges</b> and she will leave the house.<br />
